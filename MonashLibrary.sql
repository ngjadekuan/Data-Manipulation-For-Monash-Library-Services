/*
Some of the MonLib branches have become very large and it is difficult for a single manager to look after all aspects of the branch. For this reason 
MonLib are intending to appoint two managers for the larger branches starting in the new year - one manager for the Fiction collection (fiction books) 
and another for the Non-Fiction collection (non-fiction ie. reference books). The libraries which continue to have one manager will ask this manager 
to manager the branches Full collection (all books). The number of libraries which will require two managers is quite small. Change the "live" database 
to allow monLib the option of appointing two managers to a branch and track, for all managers, which collection they are managing.
